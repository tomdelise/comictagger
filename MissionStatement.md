# Mission Statement #
## The Problem ##

There is no accepted standard for tagging metadata in comic archives such as CBR and CBZ, despite the relative ease with which such archives can be generated.  For the most part, the tagging is either via ungainly long filenames, or through proprietary databases used by various reader apps, in a similar fashion as iTunes for music.  In fact, the situation is quite similar to how it was for MP3 files before the widespread use of the ID3 tag.  The ID3 tag made it possible to provide context-free metadata for each MP3 file, in a platform- and application-independent manner.

A few reader apps, such as ComicRack (available on Windows and Android only) and ComicBookLover (available on Mac OSX and iOS only) have made public their own schemes for internally tagging the comic archive with metadata, but since these efforts are compartmentalized, no other readers (as far as I know)  have seen fit to support these schemes.

## A Solution, perhaps ##

The intent of ComicTagger is provide a non-reader app that is both platform-independent and reader application agnostic.  Perhaps, by providing a independent mechanism for tagging archives, more reader apps will be motivated to support at least the reading of these tags.
